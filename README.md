Linear Algebra library for students.

This is a simple Python module who implements some of the basics algorithms from Linear Algebra, each providing a 
step-by-step description during its execution. This way, I intend to help students to have a better understanding
and get more familiarization with this field and its procedures at graduation level.

Next steps
==========

What is coming?

* More algorithms?
* User interface?
* Faster implementation?
* Translation?
